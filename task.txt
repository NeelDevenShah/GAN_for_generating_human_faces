Task: Generative AI Image Generation Assessment

Objective:

To assess candidates' proficiency in generative AI, Python programming, and working with deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow.

Task Description:

You are required to generate a realistic human image using Google Colab, a cloud-based platform for Python programming and machine learning. This task will test your understanding of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and your ability to implement them using either PyTorch or TensorFlow.

Instructions:

Setup:

Access Google Colab: Go to [colhttp://colab.research.google.comtthttps://colab.research.google.comnd sign in with your Google account.
Create a new Python 3 notebook: Click on `File` > `New notebook` > `Python 3`.

Import Libraries:

Import necessary libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, as well as any additional libraries required for image processing.

Load Dataset:

You can use pre-existing datasets like CelebA or download other human image datasets from reputable sources. Ensure that the dataset is properly preprocessed and loaded into your notebook.

Model Implementation:

Choose either PyTorch or TensorFlow to implement a generative adversarial network (GAN).
Define the generator and discriminator architectures according to the selected framework.
Train the GAN model using the loaded dataset. Experiment with hyperparameters to achieve better results.
Monitor the training process by plotting relevant metrics such as generator and discriminator losses.

Image Generation:

After training the GAN model, generate a realistic human image using the trained generator network.
Save the generated image and display it within the notebook.

Documentation:

Provide clear and concise documentation within the notebook, explaining your approach, design choices, and any challenges faced during implementation.
Include comments in your code to enhance readability and understanding.

Submission:

Once you have completed the task, share the link to your Google Colab notebook with the evaluator for review.
Ensure that the notebook is shared with the appropriate permissions to allow viewing.

Evaluation Criteria:

Quality of the generated human image.
Correctness and efficiency of the implementation.
Clarity of documentation and code readability.
Demonstrated understanding of generative AI concepts and deep learning frameworks.

Note:

You are free to refer to online resources, documentation, and tutorials during the implementation process.
Plagiarism will not be tolerated. Ensure that the code and documentation are your original work.
