# Human Face Generation using GAN Architecture

This repository contains code for generating human faces using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) architecture. GANs are a type of neural network architecture used for generating new data samples, in this case, realistic human faces. This project utilizes deep learning techniques to create high-quality synthetic images of human faces.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NeelDevenShah/GAN_for_generating_human_faces.git

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd GAN_for_generating_human_faces
```

3. Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed and the notebook is running, you can experiment with the parameters, architecture, and hyperparameters to generate human faces with different characteristics. The notebook includes sections for data preprocessing, model training, and face generation.
